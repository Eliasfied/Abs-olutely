# Technology

*The app was created with Ionic and Vue.js and written in Typescript

*no CSS Framework was used for styling. Everything was made by myself and is responsive (CSS GRID)

*For Storage I used LocalForage and for State Management Pinia

*Routing was done with vue-router(incl. dynamic routes)

*multiple Cordova/Capacitor libaries were used to get access to the mobile device functions

*reusable components and composables were used across the app (still room to improve this further)
